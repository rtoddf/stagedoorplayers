					<p>Producing Artistic Director</p>
					<img src="../images/aboutus/egizio_robert.jpg" class="pull-right treatment" alt="Robert Egizio" title="Robert Egizio" />
					<p>Originally from Philadelphia, and an alumni of the Temple University Theater school, Robert has called Atlanta home for almost 20 years. Prior to his arrival in Atlanta, he spent a number of years working and performing around the country before settling in South Florida where he was the Choreographer in Residence at Encore Alley in Vero Beach for four seasons.</p>
					<p>As an actor, his credits include performances locally, nationally and on tour, with performances onstage in the Atlanta area with The Aurora Theater, Georgia Ensemble Theater, ART Station, Onstage Atlanta, Jewish Theater of the South and right here at Stage Door Players.</p>
					<p>As a director and choreographer, Robert has been involved with numerous theater companies in the Atlanta area. He served as Choreographer in Residence for Actors Express under Chris Coleman, and has worked with ART Station, the Aurora Theatre, Gainesville Theater Alliance, Georgia Ensemble Theater, Georgia Perimeter College, The Lyric, and Onstage Atlanta.</p>
					<p>About to embark on his 10th Anniversary Season, Robert's first involvement with Stage Door Players came in 2003, when he was hired to direct and choreograph Dames At Sea. He returned the following season to direct and choreograph Ain't Misbehavin' which would go on to win the theater's annual Woodie Award for Best Show of the Year. Due to the success of that show, Robert was brought on as the new Artistic Director, and in 2005 became the first full time Producing Artistic Director in the theater's history. Over the course of the next two seasons, Stage Door made the transition from a community theater group to a fully professional company, increasing the number of Season Ticket holders from 239 in 2004 to over 1000 last season.</p>
					<p>As Stage Door Players begins its 40th Anniversary Season, Robert would like to take this opportunity to thank the Staff, Board of Directors, Season Subscribers, community partners, volunteers, artists, audience members, and sponsors for allowing him to do what he loves so very much.</p>
