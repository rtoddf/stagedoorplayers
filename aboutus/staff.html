					<h4>Robert Egizio</h4>
					<h6>Producing Artistic Director</h6>
					<p><a href="mailto:stagedoorplayers@bellsouth.net">Contact Robert</a></p>
					<p>Originally from Philadelphia, and an alumni of the Temple University Theater school, Robert has called Atlanta home for almost 20 years. Prior to his arrival in Atlanta, he spent a number of years working and performing around the country before settling in South Florida where he was the Choreographer in Residence at Encore Alley in Vero Beach for four seasons.</p>
					<p>As an actor, his credits include performances locally, nationally and on tour, with performances onstage in the Atlanta area with The Aurora Theater, Georgia Ensemble Theater, ART Station, Onstage Atlanta, Jewish Theater of the South and right here at Stage Door Players.</p>
					<p>As a director and choreographer, Robert has been involved with numerous theater companies in the Atlanta area. He served as Choreographer in Residence for Actors Express under Chris Coleman, and has worked with ART Station, the Aurora Theatre, Gainesville Theater Alliance, Georgia Ensemble Theater, Georgia Perimeter College, The Lyric, and Onstage Atlanta.</p>
					<p>About to embark on his 10th Anniversary Season, Robert's first involvement with Stage Door Players came in 2003, when he was hired to direct and choreograph Dames At Sea. He returned the following season to direct and choreograph Ain't Misbehavin' which would go on to win the theater's annual Woodie Award for Best Show of the Year. Due to the success of that show, Robert was brought on as the new Artistic Director, and in 2005 became the first full time Producing Artistic Director in the theater's history. Over the course of the next two seasons, Stage Door made the transition from a community theater group to a fully professional company, increasing the number of Season Ticket holders from 239 in 2004 to over 1000 last season.</p>
					<p>As Stage Door Players begins its 40th Anniversary Season, Robert would like to take this opportunity to thank the, Board of Directors, Season Subscribers, community partners, volunteers, artists, audience members, and sponsors for allowing him to do what he loves so very much.</p>

					<h4>George Deavours</h4>
					<h6>Wig Designer in Residence</h6>
					<p>Originally from Tennessee, George grew up around movies and theatres. His father was a manager for ABC Theaters, moving the family to several cities around the south before coming to Atlanta in 1970 as the city manager for the companies’ theatres, primarily the Fox.</p>
					<p>George finished high school at Sequoyah HS in Doraville, and then attended Auburn University for two years before transferring to the University of TN, Knoxville, where he was a theatre major.  George had taught himself to cut and style hair at 15 and later became a licensed hairstylist. Wanting to move back toward entertainment, he acquired the position of Assistant Talent Relations Coordinator for the 1982 World’s Fair. In 1983, he was Message Center coordinator and a hairstylist for the Miss USA Pageant. Later that year, he moved back to Atlanta, and quickly established himself as a very busy stylist.</p>
					<p>In 1989, at the urging of friends, George finally took the leap, and began performing on stage. After only one appearance on stage, he was cast as Harold Hill in <em>The Music Man</em> and has never looked back. He has performed in over 60 shows, and still loves the stage as much as he did on his first outing. Performances in Atlanta theatres include Atlanta Lyric Theatre, Onstage Atlanta, Theatre Gael, Neighborhood Playhouse, and of course, Stage Door Players. Some Stage Door performances include <em>Dancing at Lughnasa</em>, <em>High Society</em>, <em>Bye Bye Birdie</em>, and <em>Clue: the Musical</em>.
					George began work as a hairstylist/wigmaster/makeup artist for the stage in 1987. His work has been seen in over 170 shows in the southeast, CA, and NY, including Stage Door Players (beginning in 1993), Atlanta Lyric Theatre, Aurora Theatre, Actor’s Express, Georgia Ensemble Theatre, OnStage Atlanta, Legacy Theatre, Serenbe Playhouse, The Process Theatre, and the Springer Opera House.</p>

					<h4>Rial Ellsworth</h4>
					<h6>Sound Designer in Residence</h6>
					<p>Whenever he is not on stage, Rial enjoys being part of the incredible production team here at Stage Door. Being a child of the sixties, he has always been fascinated with the effect music and sound have on human emotions. His background includes experience as a broadcaster, audio engineer and theatrical sound designer. His first job in radio came when he was just 14 years old. There he was introduced to the basics of “old school” analog sound manipulation:  reel-to-reel recorders, a razor blade and splicing tape. In later years he and his wife Kathy formed a sound company which provided live sound reinforcement for everything from orchestras to heavy metal bands in venues ranging from strip clubs to civic auditoriums. The technology has changed dramatically over the years, but the joy of seeing how sound touches an audience is still very much in his heart. He hopes you will enjoy listening to the show as much as you enjoy seeing it!</p>

					<h4>Jane Kroessig</h4>
					<h6>Wardrobe Designer in Residence</h6>
					<p>Jane B. Kroessig began her love of costuming during Parents Weekend at Cedar Crest College in Allentown, PA. It was there that she designed her very first costume, an orange velour Snoopy costume she built for her best friend (yes, orange velour...because that was all that she could afford). The costume was a hit, and sparked an interest (and talent for accommodating any size production budget) that would eventually lead to a career.  In 2004, the artistic director of OffShoot Productions met Jane, and took a chance on an unknown, but enthusiastic, seamstress to design and produce the costumes for <em>Comedy of Errors</em>. Thus, the journey began, and the chaos continues.</p>
					<p>Jane is delighted to be returning to Stage Door after working as a freelance costume designer costuming nearly 100 shows for many Atlanta area theatres including The Essential Theatre, OnStage Atlanta, Serenbe Playhouse and The Legacy Theatre. She has been the recipient of two Metropolitan Atlanta Theatre Awards and has been nominated eight times. Some of her favorite costume productions include: <em>Jane Eyre</em>, <em>The Games Afoot or Holmes for the Holidays</em>, <em>Side Show</em>, and <em>Young Frankenstein</em>. She is originally from New Jersey, but has lived in Peachtree City, Georgia, for over 30 years with her husband, Tom. Jane holds a BFA and elementary education degree from Cedar Crest College, as well as the honor of having creating their only orange velour Snoopy. </p>
