                    <h5>Paige Mattox</h5>
                    <p>Paige Mattox is overjoyed to be spreading Christmas cheer with Stage Door, as Christmas is her favorite and Stage Door is her second home. She most recently sang, swung from the ceiling, and shot stuff this past summer in Annie, Get Your Gun (Annie Oakley), previously appearing in Kiss Me, Kate! (Lilli Vanessi) and The Mystery of Edwin Drood (Drood). Other Atlanta appearances include My Fair Lady (Mrs. Pearce) at Georgia Ensemble, Cowgirls (Lee) at Horizon Theatre, Kiss of the Spider Woman (Marta) at Actor's Express, and various productions with Fabrefaction, including Urinetown, Little Women, and Titanic. Regional favorites include South Pacific (Nellie Forbush), Sound of Music (Maria), and White Christmas (Betty Haynes) with Prather Entertainment. Paige holds a BFA in Musical Theatre from the University of Mississippi, and the fierce belief that everyone should “Adopt, Not Shop”. A nod to Celestine for being such a strong, smart, inspiring woman; love and hashtags to Diddy; love and gratitude always, always to her family; and to her forever favorite, looking forward to a lifetime of Sweet Christmases with you.</p>
