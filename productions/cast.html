                    <p>Joanna Daniel is delighted to be returning to SDP to play in this farcical mystery!!

                    <p>Bryn Striepe is really trying hard not to start this bio off with how happy she is to be a part of her first Stage Door production, because everyone says that. The problem is, it’s true. Atlanta credits include Horizon: Freed Spirits (MJ); Synchronicity: In the Next Room, or the vibrator play (Mrs. Givings), Lasso of Truth (The Amazon); Actor’s Express: Seminar (Izzy); Out of Box: Rapture, Blister, Burn (Avery); The Weird Sisters: Hot Pink (Taatanya); Pinch’N’Ouch: Wall Street Wedding (Becky); The Fern Theatre: Romeo & Juliet (Romeo), Being Alive (Jen), Macbeth (Lady Macbeth).

His last shows include The Tribute Artist with Process Theatre, Knock Em' Dead with Gypsy Theatre, and Lillian Likes It with Essential Theatre. Pat owns a trivia company called Trivial Matters, which has the best trivia games in Atlanta, and that isn't an exaggeration. He also has a Guinness World Record to his name. You should ask him about it. Pat would like to thank his lady friend and the cats. Though lets be honest, the cats probably don't care about any of this.</p>
