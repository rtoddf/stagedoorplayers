                    <h5>Jeff K. Lester</h5>
                    <p>Jeff K. Lester graduated from the Kennesaw State University's Theatre and Performance Studies program in 2014. While there, he was able to perform in the school's adaptation of W. B. Yeats' Red Hanrahan and reprise his role in the 2014 Edinburgh Fringe Festival performance. After taking some time to pursue other interests, Jeff is excited to have his first professional theater debut with Stage Door Players! He would like to thank his family and friends for their continued encouragement and love. Keep an eye out for Jeff in the upcoming web-series "Quarter Life"* starring more incredible Atlanta talent!

					<h5>Eliana Marianes</h5>
					<p>Eliana Marianes is delighted to return to Stage Door after her performance as the fiery Maria Merelli in Lend Me a Tenor. She studied Theater Studies at Emory University, and has performed with Georgia Shakespeare Festival, the Center for Puppetry Arts, ART Station, Aurora Theater, the Shakespeare Tavern, Out of Hand Theater, Synchronicity Theater, Georgia Ensemble Theater, Theater Emory, and Théâtre du Rève (in Atlanta and France), and is represented by Stewart Talent. You can also experience her work as a Viewpoints Instructor by taking her classes at the Robert Mello Studio.  She is grateful to Robert and to her real life sister, Alexis, for helping her make a joyful noise unto the Lord (albeit not always in a way the nuns would approve), and sends big love to The Walrus.  </p>

					<h5>Ann Wilson</h5>
					<p>Ann Wilson is so happy to be back at Stage Door.  Audiences may remember her as another good Catholic girl, Kate Mundy, in Stage Door's Dancing at Lughnasa.  Ann has been lucky to work with many Atlanta theatres including Alliance, Horizon, Theatrical Outfit, Actor's Express, Essential and the late, great Theatre in the Square.  She is grateful to be part of a community that produces so many bright, shiny souls.</p>

					<h5>Suzanne Zoller</h5>
					<p>Suzanne Zoller is a graduate of the University of Georgia with a BA in Theatre. She moved to Atlanta in January 2015 in order to pursue an acting career in the burgeoning film and theatre industry. Her professional roles include Olivia in Shakespeare’s "Twelfth Night" with Rose of Athens Theatre Co., Cinderella in "Into the Woods" with Circle Ensemble Theatre, Tiff in "Blackpool and Parrish" and April in "Company" both with Out of Box Theatre in Marietta. Her other passion second to performing is teaching. She is the studio manager and an instructor at Jitterbug Performing Arts in Smyrna, Ga which specializes in bringing a love and appreciation of the theatrical arts to children ages 3-12. She just finished her directorial debut with Jitterbug at the end of February with the fun and heartwarming "Seussical the Musical Jr." where all of the cast members were between the ages of 6 and 10 years old. Yes, at times it was like corralling cats but it was the most rewarding and exciting cat corralling you could ever imagine! She is so excited to make her StageDoor debut in this thought-provoking and sweet play as Mary, an outspoken nun-in-training who encourages her students to form their own thoughts and opinions. Being an educator herself, she couldn’t imagine a more fitting role. Enjoy the show, y’all! </p>
