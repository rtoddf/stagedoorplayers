					<h5>Gina Rickicki</h5>
					<p>Gina Rickicki (Felecia Dantine) loves to make people laugh: she's been doing it through her character and improv work on various stages in Atlanta since relocating from NYC a few years ago. This year is already starting with a bang- being asked to do two shows in one Stage Door season is a rare treat! She just closed "Let Nothing You Dismay" here, and previously played Maggie in "Dancing at Lughnasa" at SDP. You may have also seen her in "Hot Pink: Or Ready to Explode" (Weird Sisters), "Brick By Brick We Will Tear These Walls Apart" (Dismantle Theatre), "The Doctor, The Devil, and My Dad" at 7 Stages, or "King of Pops:The Musical" (Dad's Garage). Maybe you caught her at one of Atlanta's many live literature events such as Write Club, or her own monthly show, Naked City (at the Goat Farm). Maybe you've never seen her before, in which case, she hopes to make you laugh a bunch and likely wonder how she got so strange. </p>

					<h5>Jonathan D. Williams</h5>
					<p>Jonathan D. Williams (Gary) Ever since his second grade teacher forced him to perform in a school play as a bunny who "one day hoped to have ears", Jonathan has been performing.  Through High School and college he continued to pursue his love of theatre which paved the way for him to be involved in several plays and TV/Film productions in the Southeast. But nothing could make him more happy than having the opportunity to perform at Stage Door for the first time. Jonathan would like to thank the cast and crew of "I Hate Hamlet" and his family, Sunny, Dora, and Bobby for their unwavering support and encouragement</p>
