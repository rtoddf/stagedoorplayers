                    <h5>James Donadio</h5>
                    <p>James Donadio (Victor Velasco) is very happy to be trodding the boards again at Stage Door Players, this time as an actor. He directed the popular baseball hit, Rounding Third, for the theatre the season before last.</p>
                    <p>The veteran actor/director has had the pleasure of working in every professional theatre in the Atlanta area as well as over 200 other credits across the country. Recent in-town credits include Flan in Six Degrees of Separation at Actors Express, and Sidney Bruhl in Deathtrap at Georgia Ensemble Theatre. Other favorite roles include Andrew Wyke in Sleuth, Col. Wiley Johnson in Pure Confidence, Henry in The Lion In Winter, David McMillan in True Love Lies, Henry Higgins in Pygmalion, John Barrymore in I Hate Hamlet, and conjuring up 17 different characters with 33 costume changes in Around The World In 80 Days at Theatrical Outfit. His eclectic Film and TV credits include the Academy Award winning film The Blind Side, an episode of the wonderfully quirky web series Stranger Things, the indie horror feature Conjurer, mini series Season in Purgatory, Hallmark's The Perfect Tribute, the other "other white meat" movie of 1995 (no, not Babe) Gordy, and way back to an episode of The Streets of San Francisco as a young street tough gang banger opposite Mark Hamill just before the release of Star Wars. He is married to wonderful actress/director Shannon Eubanks, proud father of popular Atlanta actress Kate Donadio, and newly minted grandfather to Kate and her husband Jonathan MacQueen's baby boy, Flynn Oliver MacQueen.</p>

                    <h5>Rial Ellsworth</h5>
                    <p>Rial has been stumbling, stuttering and basically having the time of his life in front of Atlanta's audiences on many different stages around the city for the past eleven years. Last fall, you may have seen him here in Stage Door Players delightful hit comedy Southern Comforts. Next he will take a more serious turn, appearing in The Crucible at Actor’s Express in January. When not acting, Rial is the resident sound designer here at Stage Door Players. He wishes to thank: Robert for all the glorious challenges, adventures and successes; his cast mates for sharing their talent, friendship and professionalism; and his beautiful, talented and totally "prop"-er wife Kathy for putting up with his shenanigans. Mostly he thanks you, the audience for attending live theatre in Atlanta! Enjoy the show!</p>

                    <h5>Ann Wilson</h5>
                    <p>Ann Wilson (Ethel Banks) is delighted to be back with Stage Door for a third show, this time as Corie's mother.  Audiences may remember Ann as another mother, the Superior kind, in last season's Hail Mary!,  for which she won the Woody for best actress in a supporting role.  She also had the privilege of playing Kate Mundy in Stage Door's 2013 production of Dancing at Lughnasa.  Ann worked in theatres around the country in places like New York, North Carolina and Texas before calling Atlanta home.  She's been lucky to work with great theatres like this one, Alliance, Horizon, Theatrical Outfit, Actor's Express, Essential, Georgia Ensemble and the late, great Theatre in the Square.  What you see from Ann in this production is completely inspired by and dedicated to the memory of her own mother, Shirley. "I hit the jackpot with you, Mama.  I miss you every day."</p>
