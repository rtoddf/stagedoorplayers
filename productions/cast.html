                    <h5>Daniel Parvis</h5>
                    <p>Daniel Parvis is thrilled to be making his debut with Stage Door Players. Some of his favorite roles include
                    George in Of Mice and Men (Serenbe Playhouse), Mitch in A Streetcar Named Desire (Serenbe Playhouse), Caleb in The
                    Whipping Man (The Warehouse Theatre, Greenville SC), and Henry VI in Henry VI: Parts I, II and III. (The Atlanta
                    Shakespeare Company). He has also appeared onstage at Georgia Ensemble Theatre and Synchronicity Theatre. In film and
                    television, he has appeared in projects such as “Sleepy Hollow” (FOX), “Watchmen” (HBO), Drop Dead Diva (Lifetime) and
                    Being Mary Jane (BET). He received his BA in Theatre from University of Georgia in 2004, and he's been living and
                    working in Atlanta ever since. He apprenticed with The Atlanta Shakespeare Company in 2005, and he performed numerous
                    Shakespeare and non-Shakespeare roles over the following eight seasons. When Daniel's not acting, he's probably out
                    shooting actor headshots, theatre production and/or promotional photography, or any other assorted assignments that come
                    his way as owner and operator of Daniel Parvis Photography. Otherwise, he's probably at the dog park, strumming some
                    tunes, or tearing up the town on his motorbike (weather permitting…or not). Love to Katie.</p>
