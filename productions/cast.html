					<h5>Gina Rickicki</h5>
					<p>Gina Rickicki (Tawny, Deb, Linda) has been bringing her bold character work to the stages of Atlanta for a few years now after relocating from NYC. She's so happy to return to Stage Door since her turn as Maggie Mundy in Dancing at Lughnasa! You may have also seen her in Hot Pink: Or Ready to Explode (Weird Sisters), Brick By Brick We Will Tear These Walls Apart (Dismantle Theatre), or King of Pops:The Musical (Dad's Garage). Maybe you caught her at one of Atlanta's many live literature events such as Write Club, or her own monthly show, Naked City (at the Goat Farm). It's possible you know her from her work on her web series Ask Hatter and Hare (we're on the Facebooks). Maybe you've never seen her before, in which case, she hopes to make you laugh a bunch and likely wonder how she got so strange.</p>
