                    <p>So… What were we talking about? It seems like I was just here. I was last seen on these boards as Maestro Vito De Angelis
                    back in June. I'm delighted to be back so soon. You may have seen me around town as Judge Turpin in Sweeney Todd (Actor's
                    Express), Signor Naccarelli in The Light In The Piazza (Theatrical Outfit), Reginald Herz in The Meantime or Cord Elam in
                    Oklahoma (Theater Emory), Hank Adams, the lonely cop in Christmas Wishes (ArtStation), Capt. Von Trapp (Center Theatre) or
                    Harry, the inebriated brother of the dead Senate candidate in Lying In State (GET). Recent history also has me performing
                    a quartet of shows at The Alhambra in Jacksonville and a plum role at the Arts Center of Coastal Carolina on Hilton Head
                    Island. Thank you to my wife Valory for all that she is, to Robert for having me back and to you for supporting live theatre.
                    You're the best. (A proud member of Actor's Equity Association since 1983.)</p>
