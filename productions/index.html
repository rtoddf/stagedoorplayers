Clara, the family matriarch, runs her soup kitchen and tends to the family heirloom - a twenty-foot shrine to the Blessed Mother which adjoins the house, commemorating the day in 1942 when the Blessed Virgin Mary materialized in her father's barber shop. When daughter Ruth divulges her plan to finally “go public" with the family miracle by creating a one-woman play about the sacred event, the entire family's faith is shaken to the very core when a deathbed confession causes the family legend to unravel. </p>
