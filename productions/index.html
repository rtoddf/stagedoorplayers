                    <h3>Southern Comforts</h3>
                    <p>In a sprawling New Jersey Victorian, a taciturn Yankee widower and a vivacious grandmother from Tennessee find what they least expected - a second chance at love. Their funny, awkward, and enchanting romance is filled with sweet surprise and unpredictable tribulation. Told with warmth and perceptive humor, this off-Broadway success is an affecting, late-in-life journey of compromise and rejuvenation, of personal risk and the rewards of change.</p>

                    <h3>Let Nothing You Dismay</h3>
                    <p>It's Christmas, and Kevin and Allie are about to become parents- they're just waiting for a phone call.Â And though they've asked their families to keep their distance until they bring the baby home, of course no one keeps their distance. Kevin's father visits with his much-younger wife and their extended clan, followed by Kevin's mother with her veterinarian, her upstairs neighbor, and her favorite author, and then Allie's family invades, including her ultra-competitive sister, her Bubbie, and Bubbie's gentleman friend. Eight actors play twenty-two characters in this lightning-paced holiday farce that celebrates families of all kinds, and reminds us we're all more alike than we realize.</p>

                    <h3>I Hate Hamlet</h3>
                    <p>A young and successful television actor relocates to New York, where he rents a marvelous, gothic apartment. With his television career in limbo, the actor is offered the opportunity to play Hamlet onstage, but there's one problem: He hates Hamlet. His dilemma deepens with the entrance of John Barrymore's ghost, who arrives intoxicated and in full costume to the apartment that once was his. The contrast between the two actors leads to a wildly funny duel over women, art, success, duty, television, and yes, the apartment.</p>

                    <p>This comedy/drama, by the author of Miracle on South Division Street, introduces Mary, a plucky novice who bravely does battle with her Mother Superior, a staunch defender of "that old time religion." Mary puts her future as a nun in serious jeopardy when she dares teach the children her personal, unorthodox views of God and his commandments. Her dream of Sisterhood is further threatened with the untimely arrival of a childhood sweetheart who suddenly declares his love. Will Mary give it all up for the love of a man? Or will she listen to the priest who mysteriously appears and declares Mary to be the world's next savior?</p>

                    <p>The great backstage "show within a show" musical comedy, featuring what many call Cole Porterâs greatest score, comes to Stage Door in all its Shakespearean tongue in cheek glory. This hysterical, tuneful battle of the sexes, where each cast memberâs on-stage life is complicated by what is happening offstage, contains such Porter classics as "So In Love," "Too Darn Hot," "Wunderbar," "From This Moment On," and "Another Opening, Another Show."</p>
