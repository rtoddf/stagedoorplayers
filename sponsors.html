                        <p>"I am Alison Norris and I have been a Dunwoody Resident for over 17 years. I have over 35 years (oh my goodness am I really that old!!) of Restaurant and Catering Experience. I love to cook and have been entertaining friends and family for years around my table. Never quite sure what they are going to get to eat or, from which Country it might hail, until it appears on the plate, everyone always seems to be happy and laughter flows from the table . Of course a nice glass of wine always helps! So my hope is that you will feel the same when dining here."</p>
