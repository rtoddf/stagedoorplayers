				<h3>About Stage Door Players</h3>
                <p>Stage Door Players was founded in 1974 as a Community Improvement Project of the Dunwoody Woman&rsquo;s Club.  The community theatre performed in various locations until 1988, when a permanent home was realized in the North DeKalb Cultural Center.</p>
                <img src="images/widgets/pages/butterflies.jpg" class="treatment widget" title="Butterflies Are Free" alt="Butterflies Are Free" />
                <p>Fast forward to 2006.  Dunwoody is the major axis of North Atlanta.  It is a hub of industry, business, shopping, great restaurants, and is a thriving cultural and artistic center.  Stage Door Players has grown and evolved with its community.  Today Stage Door Players is a fully professional theatre, producing a full season of popular, compelling and entertaining works.</p>
                <p>This transition, completed in 2004, has made Stage Door Players a successful player in the Atlanta theatre scene.  Hired in 2004 as part-time Artistic Director, Robert Egizio became the full-time director in 2005.  His professionalism, creativity and reputation in Atlanta&rsquo;s theatre community has brought Stage Door Players to a new level of recognition and brought new audiences to its doors, and has brought a new level of creativity as well as new talent to the company.</p>
                <p>Stage Door Players produces a full season of professional theatre, the Stage Door Canteen cabaret series, and launched Stage Door Jr. in February 2006, a special series of Saturday productions for children.  These shows are both educational and entertaining for young audiences and their adult guests.</p>
                <p>Stage Door Players is dedicated to bringing a professional level of live theatre to the Greater Metropolitan Atlanta area.  We will always place emphasis on the quality and professionalism of our productions, while at the same time continue to educate and expand the theatrical knowledge and experience of both our audiences and our talent.  We are committed to serving the entire community and to continually developing new theatre-going audiences.</p>
