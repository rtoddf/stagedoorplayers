				<h3>Out of Order</h3>
				<p>September 21 through October 14, 2012</p>
				<p>Just in time for Election season. In the tradition of great Stage Door comedies like Perfect Wedding, Unnecessary Farce and Lend Me a Tenor, take one crafty politician, a naive typist in her underwear, an unsuspecting new husband, and a "body," that keeps disappearing, and what do you get? An evening of hysterical laughter. No one does farce like Stage Door Players!</p>

					<h4>It's a Wonderful Life: A Live Radio Play</h4>
    				<p>November 30 through December 16, 2012</p>
    				<p>This beloved American holiday film classic comes to captivating life as a live 1940s radio broadcast. With the help of a five member ensemble that brings a few dozen characters to the stage, the story of idealistic George Bailey unfolds right before our very eyes (and ears) as he considers ending his life one fateful Christmas Eve.</p>

    				<h4>Visiting Mr. Green</h4>
    				<p>January 24 through February 17, 2013</p>
    				<p>Mr. Green wanders into New York traffic and is almost hit by a car driven by Ross Gardiner. When the young man is given community service to help the recent widower we find ourselves at the start of a comedy/drama about two men who at first can't stand to be in the same room together. But as they get to know each other, they find some shaky common ground, and help to heal the old wounds they've both been hiding.</p>

    				<p>March 22 through April 14, 2013</p>

Exploring the journey from dating and waiting to love and marriage, to the agonies and triumphs of in-laws and newborns, this hilarious revue pays tribute to those, young and old, who have loved and lost, and have dared to ask, "Say, what are you doing Saturday night?"</p>

    				<h4>Dancing at Lughnasa</h4>
    				<p>May 17 through June 6, 2013</p>
    				<p>Winner of the 1992 Tony Award for Best Play, and regarded as "the most elegant and rueful memory play since The Glass Menagerie," this extraordinary drama is the story of five unmarried sisters eking out their lives in a small village in Ireland in l936. Their spare existence is interrupted by brief, colorful bursts of music from the radio, their only link to the romance and hope of the world at large. Widely regarded as Brian Friel's masterpiece, this haunting play is a tribute to the spirit and valor of the past.</p>
