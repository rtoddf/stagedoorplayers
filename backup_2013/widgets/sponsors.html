    <p>Souper Jenny is a cozy neighborhood cafe open 6 days a week (unless we're tired and cranky and need an Attitude Adjustment Day). We traditionally offer six hot soups, two sandwiches and two to four salads a day! Favorites include our My Dad's Turkey Chili, Chicken Tortilla, Souper Power Green, Ripe Avocado Pita, The Club, Big Greek Salad and Chef Jessica's Broccoli Slaw. We have gluten free, vegetarian and vegan offerings every day! The menu changes every day, but we have a handy email list to make it easier.</p>
