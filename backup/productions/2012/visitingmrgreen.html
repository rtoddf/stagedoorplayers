        				<h2>Visiting Mr. Green</h2>
        				<p>January 25 through February 17, 2013</p>
                        <p>Mr. Green wanders into New York traffic and is almost hit by a car driven by Ross Gardiner. When the young man is given community service to help the recent widower we find ourselves at the start of a comedy/drama about two men who at first can't stand to be in the same room together. But as they get to know each other, they find some shaky common ground, and help to heal the old wounds they've both been hiding.</p>
