                        <h3>Lend Me a Tenor</h3>
                        <p>May 18 through June 10, 2012<br />(Performances Friday and Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons)</p>
        				<p>The time is September, 1934. The place is the Cleveland Grand Opera Company. World famous tenor Tito Morelli is to perform <em>Otello</em>, his greatest role, at the gala season opener. Through a hilarious series of mishaps and a double dose of tranquilizers, he passes out and is no where to be found. Is Il Stupendo dead? Who will go in his place? Considered by some to be one of the greatest farces ever written, this one will have you rolling in the aisles.</p>
