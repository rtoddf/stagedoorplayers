<h4>Michael Magursky</h4>

    <h4>Jane Kroessig</h4>
    <h6>Wardrobe Designer in Residence</h6>
    <p>Jane B. Kroessig began her love of costuming during Parents Weekend at Cedar Crest College in Allentown, PA. It was there that she designed her very first costume, an orange velour Snoopy costume she built for her best friend (yes, orange velour...because that was all that she could afford). The costume was a hit, and sparked an interest (and talent for accommodating any size production budget) that would eventually lead to a career.  In 2004, the artistic director of OffShoot Productions met Jane, and took a chance on an unknown, but enthusiastic, seamstress to design and produce the costumes for <em>Comedy of Errors</em>. Thus, the journey began, and the chaos continues.</p>
    <p>Jane is delighted to be returning to Stage Door after working as a freelance costume designer costuming nearly 100 shows for many Atlanta area theatres including The Essential Theatre, OnStage Atlanta, Serenbe Playhouse and The Legacy Theatre. She has been the recipient of two Metropolitan Atlanta Theatre Awards and has been nominated eight times. Some of her favorite costume productions include: <em>Jane Eyre</em>, <em>The Games Afoot or Holmes for the Holidays</em>, <em>Side Show</em>, and <em>Young Frankenstein</em>. She is originally from New Jersey, but has lived in Peachtree City, Georgia, for over 30 years with her husband, Tom. Jane holds a BFA and elementary education degree from Cedar Crest College, as well as the honor of having creating their only orange velour Snoopy. </p>
