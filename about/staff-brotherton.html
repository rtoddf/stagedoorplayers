					<h6>Production Manager</h6>
					<p>Born and raised a Georgia girl, Hayley has been professionally Stage Managing as a freelance artist for 13 years here in Atlanta. She began her professional career as an Assistant Stage Manager for the former Theatre in the Square on Fair and Tender Ladies in 2002, and received her B.F.A from Shorter College in 2004. In the Summer of 2003 she worked for The Central City Opera Company as an Intern and Dresser for their summer stock season, which included 3 productions in repertory.</p>
					<p>From 2004-2005 she her completed her Internship as the Production Intern for Actor’s Express Theatre Company, and then began working as a freelance Stage Manager/Assistant Stage Manager for companies such as Theatre in the Square (The Library Dragon, ASM), Synchronicity Theatre (The Storytelling Ability of a Boy, The Minotaur, The Lasso of Truth), The Center for the Puppetry Arts (The Ghastly Dreadfuls, Ruth and the Green Book), Georgia Ensemble Theatre (4 years as the TYA touring Stage Manager , Becky’s New Car, Tokens of Affection, and many ASM roles), Dad’s Garage Theatre Company (over 15 productions including Song of the Living Dead, The Magic Negro, and The History of Rock and Roll) , Theatrical Outfit (A Wrinkle in Time, ASM), The Atlanta Lyric (4 total productions), 7 Stages (FML…how Carson McCullers saved my life), Actor’s Express (Bug, Hazzard County, Kimberly Akimbo) and of course, Stage Door Players where she has Stage Managed 10 productions to date.</p>
					<p>In addition to Stage Managing, she has also had the opportunity to work as an assistant scenic artist under the tutelage of the brilliant Kat Conley and Amy Ferguson at Actor’s Express, The Alliance, and Pace Academy. She also served as an Assistant Director at The Atlanta Lyric for their production of The Secret Garden. In her off time she worked as a counselor for The Ferst Center Drama camp for 4 years teaching Technical Theatre and Improvisation.</p>
					<p>In this time she received a handful of lovely acknowledgments for her work as a Stage Manager and treasures every single one of them. Having an acting degree, with a focus on Production and Stage Management has served her well in her various “9-5 day jobs”. Most recently you can find her working in the field of recruiting, and loves helping people get to work.
					She profusely thanks her Mama and Daddy for their ridiculously amazing and unwavering support, her sister, brother-in-law, and adorable niece for their love, and her 3 fur-babies for liking her no matter what mood she wakes up in.</p>
					<p>Stepping in to this role of Production Manager is thrilling step to take, and she is very excited to work with this wonderful theatre family to help keep the cogs turning at one of the greatest companies to work for in the world!</p>
