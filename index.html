                        <p>Winner of the 1992 Tony Award for Best Play, and regarded as "the most elegant and rueful memory play since The Glass Menagerie," this extraordinary drama is the story of five unmarried sisters eking out their lives in a small village in Ireland in l936. Their spare existence is interrupted by brief, colorful bursts of music from the radio, their only link to the romance and hope of the world at large. Widely regarded as Brian Friel's masterpiece, this haunting play is a tribute to the spirit and valor of the past.</p>
